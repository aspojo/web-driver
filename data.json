We are happily ob<strong>lig</strong>ed to help family members when they are sick, for instance.  Many re<strong>lig</strong>ious people who practice a re<strong>lig</strong>ion, a cultural activity which “ties” us back to our ultimate spiritual origin, are ob<strong>lig</strong>ing when it comes to “tying” help towards others in need.  If someone has torn a <strong>lig</strong>ament, or bodily tissue that “ties” together bones, you might be ob<strong>lig</strong>ing in helping that person get to the hospital.</p>\n<p>With slight spelling variants recognized, the National Football <strong>Leag</strong>ue is a “tying” together of thirty-two different football teams.  Those teams’ fans have an al<strong>leg</strong>iance to them; for instance, I might have formed an al<strong>leg</strong>iance or “tying” towards the Green Bay Packers if I had grown up in Wisconsin, where the Packers are based.</p>\n<p>The root <strong>lig</strong> also has spelling variants in <strong>li</strong> and <strong>ly</strong>.  When you re<strong>ly</strong> on someone to do something for you, you can confidently “tie” yourself back to that person’s aid; you consider that person to be re<strong>li</strong>able, or capable of being “tied” back to.  This person might also be an al<strong>ly</strong> of yours, someone to whom you “tie” yourself; hence, you have formed an al<strong>li</strong>ance with this person, a “tying” towards him.  If two companies have formed an al<strong>li</strong>ance between themselves for their mutual benefit, they have probably hired a <strong>li</strong>aison who strives to create a beneficial and communicative “tie” between those two businesses.</p>\n<p>Phew!

Most people are dying to tell their <strong>se</strong>crets, so they carefully <strong>se</strong>lect or single out or “apart” one of their friends to whom to tell the secret with the caution that the <strong>se</strong>lected friend keep it hidden.  Sometimes it’s very hard to <strong>se</strong>parate or keep “apart” one friend from the rest to whom to reveal the <strong>se</strong>cret.  That <strong>se</strong>lect friend may end up revealing the <strong>se</strong>cret anyway, which might prompt you to <strong>se</strong>ver that friendship, hence cutting it “apart” from being whole.</p>\n<p>Sometimes those things kept “apart” aren’t so good.  For instance, when Britain during Brexit <strong>se</strong>ceded or went “apart” from the European Union, there was a lot of financial difficulty.  Keeping people <strong>se</strong>gregated or “apart” from one another causes many hard feelings and is often unjust.  A <strong>sed</strong>ition or going “apart” from an existing government in a rebellion can in the long term be a good thing, but can also cause great hardship in the short term.</p>\n<p>Then again, going “apart” can have its advantages.  If you have a big test to study for, it is probably best to <strong>se</strong>clude or shut yourself “apart” from others so as to be able to concentrate.

Such <strong>fort</strong>resses or <strong>fort</strong>ifications are built with “strong” walls so as to keep people safe within.  <strong>Fort</strong> Knox, for instance, is a “strong” building keeping the United States’ supply of gold protected.  Building <strong>fort</strong>resses requires a lot of ef<strong>fort</strong> or “strong” exertion from their builders.  Sometimes <strong>fort</strong>ifications have to be rein<strong>forc</strong>ed or made “strong” again if the walls have been weakened after a <strong>forc</strong>eful or “strong” attack.  And of course the “<strong>Forc</strong>e” in Star Wars makes its successful users “strong” beyond belief.</p>\n<p>Breakfast cereals and other processed foods are often <strong>fort</strong>ified with vitamins, making their nutritional value “stronger.”  These extra vitamins hopefully make the consumer’s body com<strong>fort</strong>able or thoroughly “strong” so as to avoid discom<strong>fort</strong>, or being apart from feeling “strong.”  A great deal of <strong>fort</strong>itude or “strength” of character is needed to deal with uncom<strong>fort</strong>able health problems, so it’s best to get enough vitamins to ward off sickness or disease.  We all seek bodily com<strong>fort</strong>, or a thorough feeling of “strength” over that of debilitating weakness.</p>\n<p>Did you know that the word “piano” is short for piano<strong>fort</strong>e?  The word “piano” refers to a “soft” sound, and “<strong>fort</strong>e” is a “strong” or “loud” sound.  The piano<strong>fort</strong>e was the first keyboard instrument which had a range of volume; earlier harpsichords only had one volume!  And regarding “strength” of sound, the “f” on a sheet of music stands for “<strong>fort</strong>e,” which directs a musician to play the piece with a “strong” or “loud” sound; a “ff” indicates <strong>fort</strong>issimo, or playing with a very “strong” or loud sound!</p>\n<p>Our minds have now been <strong>fort</strong>ified with numerous examples of the root <strong>fort</strong>, which should make our knowledge of those words’ definitions ef<strong>fort</strong>less to recall as they are now a <strong>fort</strong>e or “strong” point!</p>\n<ol>\n\t<li><strong>fort</strong>: “strong” building</li>\n\t<li><strong>fortress</strong>: “strong” building</li>\n\t<li><strong>fortification</strong>: “strong” building</li>\n\t<li><strong>effort</strong>: a putting of “strong” work forth</li>\n\t<li><strong>reinforce</strong>: make “strong” again</li>\n\t<li><strong>forceful</strong>: full of “strength”</li>\n\t<li><strong>force</strong>: a “strong” power</li>\n\t<li><strong>fortify</strong>:  to make “strong”</li>\n\t<li><strong>comfortable</strong>: being thoroughly “strong”</li>\n\t<li><strong>discomfort</strong>: apart from being thoroughly “strong”</li>\n\t<li><strong>fortitude</strong>: “strength” of character</li>\n\t<li><strong>comfort</strong>: of a thoroughly “strong” feeling</li>\n\t<li><strong>pianoforte</strong>: the soft sound and “strong” as in “loud” sound instrument</li>\n\t<li><strong>forte</strong>: a “strong” sound</li>\n\t<li><strong>fortissimo</strong>: a very strong “sound”</li>\n\t<li><strong>fortified</strong>: “strengthened”</li>\n\t<li><strong>effortless</strong>: not requiring “strength”</li>\n\t<li><strong>forte</strong>: “strong” point in someone’s abilities</li>\n</ol>\n    </article>\n    <div class=\"cta\">\n      <a href=\"#/rootcasts\" class=\"btn btn-white btn-small\">Back to Rootcasts</a>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</section><section class=\"bg-blue\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n      <h2>Related Rootcasts</h2>\n      <ul class=\"rootcasts\">\n          <li>\n            <a href=\"#/rootcasts/morphology\">\n              <h3>The Fascinating Parts of Words</h3>\n              <p>Morphology is the study of how words are put together by using morphemes, which include prefixes, roots, and suffixes.

One line can also inter<strong>sect</strong> another line, “cutting” between its length.

A nation can also be considered a “father” as in a \"father\"land; a <strong>patr</strong>iot supports that \"father\"land, for which he feels a great deal of <strong>patr</strong>iotism.  All the <strong>patr</strong>iots of a \"father\"land are com<strong>patr</strong>iots, being those “<strong>patr</strong>iots” that live within the same \"father\"land.  Some <strong>patr</strong>iots are ex<strong>patr</strong>iated or thrown out of the \"father\"land for committing serious crimes; others willingly become ex<strong>patr</strong>iates for a whole host of reasons.

A person would be acting in an <strong>ab</strong>normal fashion if she were <strong>ab</strong>sent from class or work over half the time, that is, she was “away” more than she was present.  Or a person would really be <strong>ab</strong>normal if she could <strong>ab</strong>volate, or fly “away” on wings!</p>\n<p>Have you ever been <strong>ab</strong>solutely sure about something, so much so that you were loosened “away” from all doubt?  For instance, you might be <strong>ab</strong>solutely sure that you will never be <strong>ab</strong>ducted or led “away” by aliens, but then again, others apparently have … so can you be “away” from all doubt after all about that?</p>\n<p>If a queen were to <strong>ab</strong>dicate her throne, she would say that she wanted to be “away” from it, that is, step down from being a queen.  However, her people might love her so much that she would have to <strong>ab</strong>ort her plans, or be “away” from their rising successfully, thereby remaining on the throne.</p>\n<p>SpongeBob SquarePants, being a sponge and all, is really into <strong>ab</strong>sorbing water, or sucking it “away” from the surrounding ocean so that it goes into himself.  Although SpongeBob does like the soft water of the ocean, he probably wouldn’t like something <strong>ab</strong>rasive, like sandpaper, which would scrape or scratch “away” at his yellow holey awesomeness, which is just what someone like Plankton might do.  Although others might consider Plankton’s behavior to be <strong>ab</strong>errant, or wandering “away” from acceptable conduct, Plankton wouldn’t care as he scraped away in <strong>ab</strong>sent-minded, or maybe not so <strong>ab</strong>sent-minded glee!</p>\n<p>“Away” with this podcast since you are indeed now <strong>ab</strong>solutely in command of that English prefix!</p>\n<ol>\n\t<li><strong>abnormal</strong>:  “away” from being normal</li>\n\t<li><strong>absent</strong>: being “away” from a place</li>\n\t<li><strong>abvolate</strong>: fly “away”</li>\n\t<li><strong>absolutely</strong>: loosened “away” from any doubt</li>\n\t<li><strong>abduct</strong>: lead “away”</li>\n\t<li><strong>abdicate</strong>: a monarch saying she wants to be “away” from being in power</li>\n\t<li><strong>abort</strong>: “away” from rising or beginning</li>\n\t<li><strong>absorb</strong>: suck “away”</li>\n\t<li><strong>abrasive</strong>: relating to scraping “away” at</li>\n\t<li><strong>aberrant</strong>: wander “away”</li>\n</ol>\n      </article>\n    </div>\n  </section><section class=\"bg-blue\">\n      <div class=\"container\">\n        <h2>Related Rootcasts</h2>\n        <ul class=\"rootcasts\">\n            <li>\n              <a href=\"#/rootcasts/morphology\">\n                <h3>The Fascinating Parts of Words</h3>\n                <p>Morphology is the study of how words are put together by using morphemes, which include prefixes, roots, and suffixes.

 <div class=\"text-left\">\n      <p>The Latin root <strong>act</strong> means “do.”  This Latin root is the word origin of a large number of English vocabulary words, including <strong>act</strong>or, <strong>act</strong>ion, and <strong>act</strong>ive.  The root <strong>act</strong> is easily recalled via the word <strong>act</strong>, for an <strong>act</strong> is something having been “done.”</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </section><section>\n    <div class=\"container\">\n      <h2>Actors Act or \"Do\" It!</h2>\n      <article id=\"full-text\" class=\"root-text text-left\">\n        <p>The Latin root word <strong>act</strong> means “do.”  Today we will “do” our best towards learning many words with the root <strong>act</strong> in them, so let’s just “do” it!</p>\n<p>When people <strong>act</strong>, they “do” something.  An <strong>act</strong>, therefore, is something “done.”  For instance, <strong>act</strong>ors <strong>act</strong> in a play or movie, or “do” their part. The <strong>act</strong>ing provides the <strong>act</strong>ion or the “doing” of the play, except during intermission when there is in<strong>act</strong>ion or no “doing,” at least on stage.  The audience’s re<strong>act</strong>ion to the <strong>act</strong>ing is its “doing” back or response to what has transpired onstage.  Hopefully the audience will re<strong>act</strong> positively, or “do” back some loud applause!</p>\n<p>For the purpose of one’s health, it is best to be <strong>act</strong>ive, or physically “do” <strong>act</strong>ivities such as running or hiking, which are better than being in<strong>act</strong>ive, or not “doing” things.  Before one’s health fails, it is best to be pro<strong>act</strong>ive, or “doing” things that tend to ensure one’s good health.  And if one is ex<strong>act</strong>ing in exercising, that is, thoroughly “doing” it, one might not get sick hardly ever at all!</p>\n<p>Imagine you buy a car.  The “buying” is a trans<strong>act</strong>ion, that is, a “doing” where the buyer gets the car and the seller gets the money for the car.  A car seller will probably not demand an ex<strong>act</strong> amount of money, that is, making the buyer “do” a precise sum, but rather the seller will probably lower the stated price in an attempt to sell the vehicle.  Hence, the <strong>act</strong>ual or “done” amount will probably not be the sticker price, but rather something less than that.</p>\n<p>Now that we have <strong>act</strong>ivated your knowledge of the root <strong>act</strong>, you will no longer not be able to “do” words with that root in them!</p>\n<ol>\n\t<li><strong>act</strong>: to “do”</li>\n\t<li><strong>act</strong>: something “done”</li>\n\t<li><strong>actor</strong>: one who “does” her part in a play</li>\n\t<li><strong>action</strong>: the state of “doing”</li>\n\t<li><strong>inaction</strong>: the state of not “doing”</li>\n\t<li><strong>activity</strong>: a “doing”</li>\n\t<li><strong>reaction</strong>: a “doing” back</li>\n\t<li><strong>react</strong>:  to “do” back</li>\n\t<li><strong>active</strong>: of “doing” things</li>\n\t<li><strong>inactive</strong>: of not “doing” things</li>\n\t<li><strong>proactive</strong>: of “doing” beforehand</li>\n\t<li><strong>exacting</strong>: thoroughly “doing”</li>\n\t<li><strong>transaction</strong>: a “doing” across from a seller to a buyer</li>\n\t<li><strong>exact</strong>: a very accurate “doing”</li>\n\t<li><strong>actual</strong>: of that which was “done”</li>\n\t<li><strong>activate</strong>: to start something “doing”</li>\n</ol>\n      </article>\n    </div>\n  </section><section class=\"bg-blue\">\n      <div class=\"container\">\n        <h2>Related Rootcasts</h2>\n        <ul class=\"rootcasts\">\n            <li>\n              <a href=\"#/rootcasts/morphology\">\n                <h3>The Fascinating Parts of Words</h3>\n                <p>Morphology is the study of how words are put together by using morphemes, which include prefixes, roots, and suffixes.
